Describe:
### Q1 Before start working on the problems, here is a small example to help you understand how to write your own answers.
### In short, the solution should be written within the function body given, and the final result should be returned. 
### Then the autograder will try to call the function and validate your returned result accordingly.

### Find a list of all of the names in the following string using regex.

import re
def names():
    simple_string = """Amy is 5 years old, and her sister Mary is 2 years old. 
    Ruth and Peter, their parents, have 3 kids."""

    names = re.findall(r"[A-Z][a-z+]{2,}", simple_string)
    return names

    # names is a list of all words that start with uppercase
n = names()

    # You can now join or iterate throw this list to print each name using for loop
for i in range(len(n)):
    # get a string with only names

    words = "".join(n[i])
    print(words)
    
### Q2 The dataset file in [assets/grades.txt](assets/grades.txt) contains a line separated list of people with their grade in 
### a class. Create a regex to generate a list of just those students who received a B in the course.

import re


def grades():
    with open("assets/grades.txt", "r") as file:
        grades = file.read()
        return re.findall("(.*): B", grades)

print(grades())

### Q3 Consider the standard web log file in assets/logdata.txt. This file records the access a user makes when visiting a web page (like this one!). 
### Each line of the log has the following items:

### a host (e.g., '146.204.224.152')
### a user_name (e.g., 'feest6811' note: sometimes the user name is missing! In this case, use '-' as the value for the username.)
### the time a request was made (e.g., '21/Jun/2019:15:45:24 -0700')
### the post request type (e.g., 'POST /incentivize HTTP/1.1' note: not everything is a POST!)
### Your task is to convert this into a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary looks like the following:

### example_dict = {"host":"146.204.224.152", 
###                "user_name":"feest6811", 
###                "time":"21/Jun/2019:15:45:24 -0700",
###                "request":"POST /incentivize HTTP/1.1"}

import re
def logs():
    with open("assets/logdata.txt", "r") as file:
        logdata = file.read()
        i = []
        resour = re.finditer('(?P<host>[\w\S]*)(\W{3})(?P<user_name>[\S]*)(\W{2})(?P<time>[^]]*)(\W*)(?P<request>[^"]*)("\s\d*\s\d*\s*)', logdata, re.VERBOSE)
        for item in resour:
            i.append(item.groupdict())
        return i
logs()
